# Objective:
Review logs of an exploitation of documented HTTP and DNS vulnerabilities.

Part 1: Investigate an SQL Injection Attack
Part 2: Investigate DNS Data Exfiltration

# Purpose:
MySQL is a popular database used by numerous web applications. Unfortunately, SQL injection is a common web hacking technique. It is a code injection technique where an attacker executes malicious SQL statements to control a web applicationâ€™s database server.

Domain name servers (DNS) are directories of domain names, and they translate the domain names into IP addresses. This service can be used to exfiltrate data.

Cybersecurity personnel have determined that an exploit has occurred, and data containing PII may have been exposed to threat actors. You  will use Kibana to investigate the exploits to determine the data that was exfiltrated using HTTP and DNS during the attacks.
